		<h1>Autodesk</h1>
			<p><b>Autodesk, Inc.</b> is an American <u>multinational software</u> corporation that makes software for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, and entertainment industries. Autodesk is headquartered in <i>San Rafael, California,</i> and features a gallery of its customers' work[4] in its San Francisco building. The company has offices worldwide, with U.S. locations in Northern California, Oregon, Colorado, Texas and in New England in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, and Canada locations in Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta. The company was founded in 1982 by <b><i>John Walker</i></b>, a coauthor of the first versions of <b><u>AutoCAD</u></b>, the company's flagship <i><u>computer-aided design</u></i> <b>(CAD)</b> software. Its AutoCAD and Revit software is primarily used by architects, engineers, and structural designers to design, draft, and model buildings and other structures. Autodesk software has been used in many fields, from the New York Freedom Tower[5] to Tesla electric cars.[6] Autodesk became best known for <b>AutoCAD</b> but now develops a broad range of software for design, engineering, and entertainment as well as a line of software for consumers, including <i>Sketchbook,</i> Homestyler, and <u>Pixlr.</u> The company makes educational versions of its software available at no cost to qualified students and faculty through the <u><i>Autodesk Education Community,</i></u> and also as a donation to eligible nonprofits through <u>TechSoup Global.</u> Autodesk's <i>digital prototyping software,</i> including <u><i>Autodesk Inventor</i></u>, <b><i>Fusion 360</i></b>, and the <b><i>Autodesk Product Design Suite,</i></b> are used in the manufacturing industry to visualize, simulate, and analyze real-world performance using a digital model during the design process.[7] The company's <b>Revit</b> line of software for <i>Building Information Modeling</i> is designed to let users explore the planning, construction, and management of a building virtually before it is built.[8] Autodesk's <b><u><i>Media and Entertainment division</i></u></b> creates software for visual effects, color grading, and editing as well as animation, game development, and design visualization.[9] 3ds Max and Maya are both 3D animation software used in film visual effects and game development.</p>
